### Approximation of Real Estate Prices using Machine Learning Algorithms
Using the dataset <i>housing.csv</i> which contains characteristics about houses in the state of california ,
we develop the following 3 machine learning algorithms: 
<ul>
<li>Least Mean Squares</li>
<li>Least Squares</li>
<li>neural network</li>
</ul>
in order to predict the median value of a property in the state of california.

This project was written in <b>Matlab</b> and in collaboration with <b>Mirto Spatha( https://github.com/MirtoSpatha )</b>.
